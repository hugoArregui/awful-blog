Literature (from Latin litterae (plural); letter) is the art of written work.
The word literature literally means "things made from letters." Literature is
commonly classified as having two major forms—fiction & non-fiction—and two
major techniques—poetry and prose.

Literature may consist of texts based on factual information (journalistic or
non-fiction), a category that may also include polemical works, biography, and
reflective essays, or it may consist of texts based on imagination (such as
fiction, poetry, or drama). Literature written in poetry emphasizes the
aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language—such as sound, symbolism, and
metre—to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, ordinary meanings,
while literature written in prose applies ordinary grammatical structure and
the natural flow of speech. Literature can also be classified according to
historical periods, genres, and political influences. While the concept of
genre has broadened over the centuries, in general, a genre consists of
artistic works that fall within a certain central theme; examples of genre
include romance, mystery, crime, fantasy, erotica, and adventure, among others.
