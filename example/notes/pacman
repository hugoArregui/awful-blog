The pacman package manager is one of the major distinguishing features of Arch
Linux. It combines a simple binary package format with an easy-to-use build
system. The goal of pacman is to make it possible to easily manage packages,
whether they are from the official Arch repositories or the user's own builds.

Pacman keeps the system up to date by synchronizing package lists with the
master server. This server/client model also allows the user to
download/install packages with a simple command, complete with all required
dependencies.

Pacman is written in the C programming language and uses the .pkg.tar.xz package format.
